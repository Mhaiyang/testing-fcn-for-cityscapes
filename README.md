Using fully convolutional networks for semantic segmentation (Shelhamer et al.) with caffe for the cityscapes dataset 

## How to get started
- Download the cityscapes dataset and the vgg-16-layer net
- Modify the images in the dataset with cut_images.py or downscale_images.py for less resource demanding training and evaluation
- Create the 32 pixel stride net with net_32.py 
- Modify the paths in train.txt and val.txt (first line: path to training/validation images, second line: path to annotations)
- Start training with solve_start.py 
- Run evaluate_models.py to evaluate your model or create_eval_images.py to create images with pixel label ids
